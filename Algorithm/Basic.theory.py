# Algorithm
# A step-by-step procedure listing the tasks to be performed in order to solve a problem
# Corresponds to steps 5 and 6 of the problem solving method below
# How to solve the problem
'''
Step 1: Clearly understand what the problem is.
Step 2: Abstract the problem and break it down into simple elements.
Step 3: Analyze the relationship between elements and identify patterns.
Step 4: Model reality based on the identified patterns.
#(Algorithm configuration method)
Step 5: Create small, actionable tasks based on the model.
Step 6: Arrange tasks in order in the most efficient way.
Step 7: Run.

# example
# 1
print ('이름입력란:',end ='')
name =input ()
print (f'안녕? {name }아')
# 2
name =input ('이름입련란: ')
print (f'안녕? {name }아')
# The above was processed in the form of input (string), omitting print() to increase the efficiency of the task.

#computationalthinking
The process of disassembling and assembling objects to find effective solutions to problems
Thinking process that creates integrated solutions through iteration
# Solving through computational thinking
Abstraction: Finding the most relevant information to solve a problem
Remove irrelevant details
Decomposition: Breaking down a problem into small, manageable parts
Pattern recognition: Analyzing data to identify
Identifying commonalities and relationships between objects
Algorithmic thinking: can be repeated by humans or computers
Develop a reusable step-by-step process
